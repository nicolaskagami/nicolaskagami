👋 Hey. I'm Nicolas. Find me online @ [linkedin.com/in/nicolaskagami](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolaskagami/), mail @ nicolaskagami@gmail.com.

### Currently

- consulting engineer @ __Netmetric__ (with Telefónica), working on network measurement and TLS
- interested in Rust, networking, and distributed systems

### Past experiences

- senior software engineer @ __Ditto__, where I built mesh networking infrastructure in Rust — routing protocols, overlay networks, and topology optimization
- lead engineer @ __Netmetric__, where I led a nationally-certified network measurement platform with 20M+ probes, built high-efficiency C/C++ apps on Android and Linux, and wrangled 60+ network KPIs out of a multi-agent coordination system
- MSc student @ __UFRGS__, researching network capacity and bandwidth estimation using P4 and In-band Network Telemetry
